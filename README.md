# Flappy Bird (using Pygame)

A clone of the popular app *Flappy Bird*, using Pygame.

I'm not actively maintaining this code; this repo is an archive of the code I
wrote for the above question, and some fixes. 

## Playing the game

You control the little bird. You can make it climb by pressing `↑` (up), `⏎`
(return), `␣` (space), or clicking into the window. Don't crash into any pipes!
For every pipe you pass without colliding, you get one point.
